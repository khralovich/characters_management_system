# DnD character management system

### Functionality:
1. Assigning a name by the user (input-output operation)
2. Randomizing and assigning character statistics using std::rand (data types, functions, constants and variables)
3. User menu: create a new character or select from the list of existing ones -- search by class and race, show the number of already saved characters (range loop, sorting and search algorithms)
4. Writing characters to a file, reading from a file
5. Assigning equipment depending on the background (if else)
6. Lambda fn for spellcasting abilities and/or attack bonuses
7. Biography and description of the hero based on their class/race/bg (text chains, reading and writing the chain)
8. Sorting equipment every time a character gets a new item

### Additional feature:
A multi-user dungeon like mini-game (a 2d array, where 0 is a normal terrain, 1 is a fight, 2 is an item etc -- mind the borders!)
